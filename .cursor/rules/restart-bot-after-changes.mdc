# Restart Bot After Code Changes

After making **any** code changes to this project (bot, worker, config, api, scripts that affect runtime), **always** restart the bot so it picks up the changes.

## How to restart

From the project root (`track`):

```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\Satanshu Mishra\Documents\DevLabs\WorldOfWarships\track"; .\scripts\dev.ps1 restart
```

Or if the shell is already in the project root:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev.ps1 restart
```

This stops the bot and worker, flushes Redis queues, then starts both again. Do this in the same turn as your edits (or immediately after) so the running bot reflects the latest code.
